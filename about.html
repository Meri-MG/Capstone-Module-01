        <p>A Yoga retreat involves a higher focus on mental state in addition to the physical movements and breathing that in turn relieve stress, calm the emotions along with precision sculpting your figure into a lean, flexible and physically strong body.</p> 
        <p>Ancient Yogis believed that in order for man to be in balance and harmony with himself and his environment, he has to integrate the body, mind and spirit. For the three to be integrated, emotion, action and intelligence will need to be in balance. They created a way to achieve and maintain this balance through exercise, breathing and meditation which form the three main pillars of Yoga structures. Today there are six branches of yoga – each with their own special focus. </p> 
        <p>A yoga retreat is a great healing holiday as it appeals to people of a wide age range and physical condition with different levels of fitness and can easily be adapted to. On a spa escape, yoga teachers are able to safely guide and advise you on the best movements, poses and exercises based on your body’s needs. This is the ideal opportunity to learn from experts and integrate a healthier way of life. For experienced yoga students, there are great options to be guided into further levels of yoga in breathtaking surroundings.
